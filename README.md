Enhanced Zeus Modules
Enhanced Zeus Modules (EZM) was originally created by GamesByChris and M9-SD. With Expung3d doing slight edits and additions. EZM was adapted to be a composition by Expung3d and made into EZM Lite who added many new features and made the scripts available to all.

What It Does
EZM Lite adds a ton of new modules to Zeuses at the click of a button. Simply placing the composition as Zeus will add all of the modules to Zeus without the need for mods. In addition, everything is client side, no need to worry about lagging the server.

In addition to new modules, EZM adds new vanilla factions to the Zeus interface. Such as: the Malden Defense Force (non-canon), FIA Plus, Better Civilians, and more to be added in future.

These are specifically built for Arma 3 Public Zeus servers, with everything within the script complying with the BattlEye filters applied to the Official Servers.
